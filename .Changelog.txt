[SIZE=4][COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Update to Beta 2.8 - Assassin's Spoon [/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]

[B]Yada-yada-yada:[/B]
The word "fixed" has mostly disappeard from these changelogs *feelsgoodman*. This means we are even closer to leave beta status behind and look ahead to the coming v3.0 release that will serve as template for other Editions.
Progress has slowed down a little due to RL-work, but I think I will have at least 1 Edition fully done until the end of the month, possibly earlier. Stay tuned.



Enjoy!

[B]Changelog DnD 5E Ruleset:[/B]

[LIST]
[*]Minor Icon Tweaks
[*]Added 1 Hand, 2 Hand and Off-Hand Actions Tab graphics.
[*]Changed Player - chosen color dot - on Character Portrait to be clearer.
[*]Added missing Radial Menu Character Selection "Add Character" entry
[*]Added unique radial menu "take ownership" Icon to character selection - thanks to Saagael for the necessary script overwrite.
[*]Changed text selection color again, to not collide with search field color.
[*]Image Panel now features my dark UI as well, as a bug has been fixed by Moon Wizard that prevented my changes from working in the top area.
-> My influence on this area is still limited though, thus it doesn't look quite like I'd want it to. Oh well....
[*]Adjusted the new Attunement Icon. This might change at some point later, but will do for now. I also changed the red color for max attuenments, to match the theme.
[*]Adjusted Image Scroll and Pan button.
[*]Changed cogwheel in the options menu to link icon, to emphasize that those are linkable as well.
[*]Adjusted vote check pngs.
[*]Updated minimized window graphics to also have the 1px bright and 2px black border.
[*]Small magnifier glass in asset view now features a dark background to not visually merge with the folder icons.
[*]Script fuled icon change for "add entry" in the parcels window to not use the one from the character selections frame (Why smiteworks, why!).
[*]Added new image toolbar toggles (player vision and shortcut on/off).
