[SIZE=4][COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Update to Beta 2.7 - Doting Elderbrain [/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]

We are closing in on leaving beta status.

This release adds in basic PFRPG2 support that will be fleshed out more in the coming weeks.
I'll collaborate with AlaskanFalcon and his table to find bugs and missing stuff.
I won't go into that much detail with this ruleset, as my focus still lies with 5E, but it gets rid of some annyoing showstoppers if you're using Pathfinder 2E.


I have added in all missing radial menu icons. Some of them are hardcoded unfortunately and can't be made unique, which is really annyoing.
Big thank you to Saagael who made some scripts to overwrite icons where possible!

It gets harder and harder from this point onward to change details, as I hit roadblocks a lot more often, like in the example above.
Some things will probably never be changed, but the theme itself is in a very good state and almost ready to serve as template for other editions.
The final push will happen in the coming weeks and then the edition fun begins again. I'm especially thrilled to not only provide a color blind edition, but a bright one as well!

Enjoy!
