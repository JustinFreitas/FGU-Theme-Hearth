[LIST]
[*] Reworked radial menu and icons. (Still WIP))
[*] Added brighter 1px rim to frames for better visibility if stacked on top of each other
[*] Adjusted Image Window Icons
[*] Adjusted Image Window Frame to properly show frame borders.
[*] Adjusted some CT Icons
[*] Fixed Image Frame Borders when not set as background mode. An invisible space is still around it unfortunately. Don't know yet how to adjust the xml accodingly.
[*] Added additional Icon to the image share menu making it 3 tiered instead of two-tiered, allowing for unique icons. BIG THANKS TO SAAGAEL!
    -> Unfortunately the way FGU is coded, this is not allowed for other share menus like on traits, spells and the like, still resulting in menus with either 3 oder 2 tiers and only the color red and green.
    -> The "reset fog of war icon" is also not changeable to something else, so it still uses the icon_token_visiblity_off icon (closed red eye). Nothing I can do about that.
[*] Added additional Icon to the rest menu making it 3 tiered instead of two-tiered, allowing for unique icons. BIG THANKS TO SAAGAEL!
