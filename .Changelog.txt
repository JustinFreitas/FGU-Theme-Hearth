[SIZE=4][COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Update to Beta 2.9 - Pathhider[/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]

[B]Yada-yada-yada:[/B]
This update focuses on missing elements for the Pathfinder 2E and the ICRPG Ruleset.
Its add some prominent missing frames for Pathfinder Reference Manuals, as they come with a lot more variety than the 5E or Core Ruleset.

What else? I adjusted some icons here and there, but no major changes or additions, most likeley no one will ever notice.
This is the last Beta Update, Release Edition, here we come!

Enjoy!
