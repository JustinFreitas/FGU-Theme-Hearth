[COLOR=#FF8C00][SIZE=4][B]Update to v2.9.17 - Floating Anvil[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]


[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Announcement:[/B][/COLOR]

Minor but impactful visual adjustments to frames. I changed the border style and added headers back in.
I felt like windows were too floaty and needed more of a visual anchor., please let me know what you think of the change.
