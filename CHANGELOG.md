[*] Exchanged Map Pins to not wander slightly depending on zoom level. They are a lot smaller again like the original ones. Not very happy about this, but must do for now. (Thanks to RocketVaultGames for spotting this.)
[*] Fixed Moon Tracker Config Windowframe (somewhat, still broken)
[*] Changed Reference Manual Headers to use the new bleached red color.
[*] Fixed missing tooltips for add- and delete action in the character actions tab radial menu. (thx MeAndUnique).

[LIST]
[*] Fixed use power icon on Character sheet and made it more prominent and in line with the theme.
[*] Adjusted Options Link Icon to be less BUTT UGLY!!!!
[*] Adjusted Charsheet Tabs to also use the double outline. Proper rendering seems to fail at my resolution within FGU. Unsure if this is caused by FGU or during png compression. Investigating.
[*] Adjusted Modcollector to also use double borders and removed the static "points" on it.
