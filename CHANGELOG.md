[COLOR=#FF8C00][SIZE=4][B]Update to v2.9.21 - Knightowl[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]

[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Announcement:[/B][/COLOR]

Thanks to the amazing JustinFreitas some fixes are provided for the recent changes Smite Works did to how Themese are set-up. Make sure to shower him with praise!
Since I haven't taken a closer look on what was changed, 

My current work scedule doesn't allow me to allocate time to anything else and during the few hours of free time I'm too exhausted to actually work on the theme right now, please bear with me.
The Update is now live on the forge, in case you have used the Version posted my JustinFreitas in this thread, you don't need to delete it, it will get overwritten if you update though the forge.

Cheers Sir Motte

If your Theme's Version number goes down from 2.9.22 to 2.9.21, this is intended, as I don't jump numers for the main branch releases (in case you used Justins Version)
