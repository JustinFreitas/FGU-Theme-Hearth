[LIST]
[*] Exchanged Map Pins to not wander slightly depending on zoom level. They are a lot smaller again like the original ones. Not very happy about this, but must do for now. (Thanks to RocketVaultGames for spotting this.)
[*] Fixed Moon Tracker Config Windowframe (somewhat, still broken)
[*] Changed Reference Manual Headers to use the new bleached red color.
[*] Fixed missing tooltips for add- and delete action in the character actions tab radial menu. (thx MeAndUnique).
