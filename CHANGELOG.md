[COLOR=#FF8C00][SIZE=4][B]Update to v2.9.18 - xxx[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]


[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Announcement:[/B][/COLOR]

Test ready update that fixes some minor issues that came up and adjusts details here and there.

[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Theme Changes:[/B][/COLOR]
- Decreased Window Header height so fonts look more centralized.
- Removed Window Header from Chat as it doesn't need one in my opinion.
- Removed additional lines from sidebar buttons. Got a little confusing with all the lines near each other.
- Adjusted new token height implementation font colors.
- Made AC Icons more prominent again.
- fixed "usepower" icon on actions tab.
