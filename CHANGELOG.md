[COLOR=#FF8C00][SIZE=4][B]Update to v2.9.18 - Adjective Noun Theme[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]


[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Announcement:[/B][/COLOR]

More UI refinement that fixes some long standing issues that bothered me. Thanks to the Grimpress Community who provided the version name, it is truly unique and recognizable :X .

[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Theme Changes:[/B][/COLOR]
[*] Decreased Window Header height so fonts look more centralized.
[*] Removed Window Header from Chat as it doesn't need one in my opinion.
[*] Removed additional lines from sidebar buttons. Got a little confusing with all the lines near each other.
[*] Adjusted new token height implementation font colors.
[*] Made AC Icons more prominent again.
[*] Fixed "usepower" icon on actions tab.
[*] Darkened sidebar
[*] Reduced asset folder icon size
