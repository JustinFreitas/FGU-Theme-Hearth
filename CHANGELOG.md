[COLOR=#FF8C00][SIZE=4][B]Update to v2.9.17 - Floating Witch[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]


[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Announcement:[/B][/COLOR]

Minor but impactful visual adjustments to window frames. I changed the border style and added headers back in and introduced a new, desaturated red color tone that is easy on the eyes and doen't pop out like previous iterations of frame headers did.
I felt like windows were too floaty and needed more of a visual anchor. Please let me know what you think of the change.
