Furthermore some extensions have received some love and a few buttons got a facelift. Special thanks to RocketVaultGames for his detailed bug reports! A few fixes in regard of Combat Timer by Zygmund Molotch and Moon Tracker are in the pipeline, though they are low impact.

[LIST]
[*] Fixed use power icon on Character sheet and made it more prominent and in line with the theme.
[*] Adjusted Options Link Icon to be less BUTT UGLY!!!!
[*] Adjusted Charsheet Tabs to also use the double outline. Proper rendering seems to fail at my resolution within FGU. Unsure if this is caused by FGU or during png compression. Investigating.
[*] Adjusted Modcollector to also use double borders and removed the static "points" on it.
