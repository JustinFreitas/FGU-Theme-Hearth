[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Announcement:[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Fixes:[/B][/COLOR]
    [LIST]
        [*]Fixed - Mutant Crawl Classic popping Errors when opening NPC sheets. Cause was, that my compatibility adjustments for Death Indicator rely on the "actext" control, which is not present in MCC (and possibly Dungeon Crawl Classic as well?). This caused the error to appear. Please try my theme again, and report any findings to me.
