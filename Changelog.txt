        [*]Fixed Tokenbag asset icon not showing correctly
        [*]Exchanged all closed eye symbols with the same icon as the opened eye, only color indicates the state now. Reinstated eye symbol in the chat instead of the "hidden roll" text to be less obtrusive and in line with everything else.
        I'm still unsure about how to approach this in another way, since the menu item is not a button. Adding a square or circle around the eye symbol like I do for most klick-able ui elements isn't possible, because of the way it is implemented into the ui. If I did this, it wouldn't be discernible at all.
