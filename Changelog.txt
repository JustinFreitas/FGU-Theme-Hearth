[LIST]
[B]Changelog:[/B]
[*] Increased Link Icons size
[*] Changed some icons for chat dice
[*] Darkened Character Sheet Tabs for better readability.
[*] Fixed Dice Tower Frame - bounding box was huge, resulting in overlapping areas when placed near other windows or the hotkey bar. (thanks to WeezelD on Discord for pointing this out.)
[*] Changed Pin color to be in Line with theme, hopefully this also helps with visibility.
