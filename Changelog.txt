[B]Changelog - Theme Elements:[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Changed sidebar button size to show 1px of the background and muted border color a little, as it's not necessary to have them this bright in this area.
[*]Minor "Roll initiative all" button adjustement in the CT menu.
[*]Changed Dual Wield Icon Color in Actions Tab from Orange to Red, as Orange is supposed to be the "UI element active" color.
[*]Changed "on hover" button state for eg. help or close window to yellow, instead of orange, as orange is supposed to be the "UI element active" color.
[*]Changed "on press" button sown state for eg. close window to a bright red, instead of dark red, so when pressed they don't appear to vanish.
[*]Fixed color inconsistencies for bright red ui elements.
[*]Fixed record sheet graphic, that was off 1px, casuing cutoff frames in eg. items, encounters and other ui elements.
[*]Fixed new Radial Menu colors from last update - forgot to include the altered pngs.
[*]Changed die calculated result color to saturated yellow, to better "pop" at a glance.
[*]First batch of sidebar icons, experimental as I like the new default ones quite a lot.
[*]Changed Module loaded/unloaded icon size

Explaination: Depending on the number of extensions you use, things get pretty wild in the Chat on launch. I try to remedy this a little my adjusting extension icons to use the same width and height and frame.
