[SIZE=4][COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Update to Version 2.9.2 - Stale Holy Water[/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]

[B]Anouncement:[/B]

Minor Maintenance update with a few adjustments here and there. Mainly to announce that I'm kinda back again.
I plan to work at least 1 day each weekend on the theme to bring it up to snuff and finally make it a proper template.
Fingers crossed on this :) .

Enjoy!
