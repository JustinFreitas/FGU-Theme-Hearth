    [LIST]
        [*]Chat color rework - I hope this helps with clarity, feedback appreciated!
        [*]Adjusted some frames/buttons/icons to use 1px rounded edges as all other do as well.
        [*]Changed Chat_Wait Icon (the one that appears when someone is typing) to b yellow and not look like a thought bubble.
        [*]Changed button_speak (the one used when you want to talk with the identity of a creature / character) to yellow and not look like a thought bubble.
        [*]Adjusted all Radial Menu Icons to use Roboto Black instead of regular, where present.
        [*]Changed acicon border (shield symbol behind the AC value) to match other frames and to no clash with proficiency star. (mostly 5E relevant)
        [*]Changed magnifying glass to cogwheel. No one I every played with understood from the get go what that icon was for until explained (or tested).
        [*]Fixed Misaligned Character Sheet Tabs in 5E and made them protrude a little more, they are all over the place in any other ruleset however.
        [*]Removed Color from Melee, Ranged, Thrown, Off Hand, Primary Hand and two handed icon in the Character Sheet's actions tab I found the colours too distracting and not helpful for "at a glance" comprehension.
        [*]Altered "Off Hand" Character Sheet Icon to have the same line weight as the "Primary Hand" and "Two Handed" Icons.
        [*]Changed Empty Portrait Frame to better convey interaction possibility.
        [*]Changed Field Focus Frame to be more prominent by using blue.
        [*]Remade Dice Color Picker pngs.
        [*]Minor Changes to Chat Icons
        [*]Horizontally Flipped Vehicle Sidebar Icon (little horsy is now riding out).
        [*]Added Import Text Button in NPC Window
