The incredible MeAndUnique has outdone himself again and created something awesome. Really dude, the things you touch turn to gold!
He wrote a script that makes changing colors within xml and lua childsplay. In conjunction with my design document that I prepared for similar ease of use, you can now make your very own color scheme of my theme with just a little effort.



Enjoy!
