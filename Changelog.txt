[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Announcement:[/B][/COLOR]
    This weeks update is now live on the Forge and GitHub.

    Maintenance Update das addresses a few missing items and added stuff from last update.
    Also I finally got around to add in the condition icons that are shown on map tokens.

    Special thanks to MeAndUnique and Saagael, as well as all the wonderful folks at the Unofficial Developers Guild.

    Enjoy!
    Sir Motte
