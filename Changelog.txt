[B]Changelog - Theme Elements - Extension Icons:[/B]

Explanation: Depending on the number of extensions you use, things get pretty wild in the Chat on launch. I try to remedy this a little by adjusting extension icons to use the same width, height and frame.
This calms down the chaos and gives me the opportunity to better embed other authors extension icons, without changing them altogether. Purely Cosmetic Madness.

[B]Supported Extension changes:[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Updated support for Player Agency by Damned
[*]Kingdom & Warfare Battle tracker support brought to you by MeAndUnique.
[*]Changed Legendary Assistant's (by Stv) CT outline to be solid instead of dashes.
[*]Arcane Ward by Ryan Hagelstrom - Ryan was so kind to add an extra icon defintions to his extension. Now I can appease my obsessive-compulsive-disorder to not have truncated icons anywhere. Now, when casting using his extension the chat still looks fine. NICE!
[*]Exchanged all MeAndUnique Extension Announcement Icons with High Rez versions. Results in minor quality improvement within FGU. that you wouldn't notice ever (￣へ￣）.
