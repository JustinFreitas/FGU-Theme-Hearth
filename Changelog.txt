[COLOR=#FF8C00][SIZE=4][B]Update to Beta 2.9.11 - Penpot and Lunacy[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]


[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Announcement:[/B][/COLOR]
    This weeks update is now live on the Forge and GitHub.

    It entails small modifications to very frequently used buttons, to make them stand out more and be in line with other buttons as well.
    Please tell me what you think of it.

    Other than those there are no major changes or additions, as I had little time to work on it. 
    The next update will be a little bigger and hopefully address some lingering issues with 4E and Classic.
    
    Enjoy!
    Sir Motte
