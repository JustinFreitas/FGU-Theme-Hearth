[SIZE=4][COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Update to Version Beta 2.9.8 - Baldurs Catdoor[/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]

[B]Announcement:[/B]
    This weeks update is now live on the Forge or GitHub.

    It focuses on bringing in basic support for the 2E ruleset. Right now 2E still has a lot of missing frames, but the glaring issues in the character sheet and Combat tracker have been taken care of.
    The rest will follow piecemeal with the coming updates. Also, while I had planned to make 3.0 the big release for leaving beta and branching out again, I will postpone this to another version number.

    Enjoy!
