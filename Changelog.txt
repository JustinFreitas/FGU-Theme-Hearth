[SIZE=4][COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Update to Version 3.0 - Release the Kraken![/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]

[B]Anouncement:[/B]

3.0 - Finally. The long awaited End of Beta and the great reveal! * Dun Dun Dun *

The incredible MeAndUnique has outdone himself again and created something awesome. Really dude, the things you touch turn to gold!
He wrote a script that makes changing colors within xml and lua childsplay. In conjunction with my design document that I prepared for similar ease of use, you can now make your very own color scheme of my theme with just a little effort.



Enjoy!
Sir Motte
