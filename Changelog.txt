[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Changelog Theme Elements:[/B][/COLOR]
    [LIST]
        [*]Increase contrast for all beige UI elements slighty (#EBBDBA -> #FFF0CA)
        [*]Removed Metallic look from all chat elements but for the GM icon and the extension announcment icons.
        {*]Removed duplicate sheetlabelinline font definition (Thanks to Zarestia for spotting this.)
        [*]Changed radial magic wand icon to better convey its cleanup function of statblocks for import.
        [*]Added new <icon name="num1" file="graphics/radial/icon_dice_1.png" /> that is used in the reworked formation tab.
        [*]Removed Metallic Effect from chat icons but for the DM. I found it too distracting during actual play.
        [*]Added missing Condition Icons.
        [*]If you read this changelog, you can request your very own GM Icon extension, contact me.
        [*]Made gear Icon on Charsheet 2px smaller to better fit its background
        [*]Changed sidebar Partysheet icon to be in line with other icons
        [*]Adjusted hit and critical hit chat icons to be more distinct.

        [*]Made select chat fonts bold for better readaility.
        [*]Changed chatcolors again for msgfont. The pale green was a complimentary color, but ultimately a cold one and thus unfit for the warm colors everywhere else.
        [*]Fixed referencepage graphic - had the original still in the background, leading to smudgy edges.
        [*]Remade sidebar Character Selection and Party sheet icon to be in line with the look and feel of other icons.
        [*]Filled out sidbar image icon mountain and sun to be in line with other icons.
        [*]Adjusted Chat portrait size to be slightly smaller, to be in line with other icons.
        [*]Slightly adjusted empty portrait symbol
        [*]Fixed Character Sheet empty Token icon to not be tiny.
        [*]Made gear icon in character sheet (and possibly other places) another 2px smaller to not stand out as much.
