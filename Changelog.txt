[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Altered Theme Elements:[/B][/COLOR]
    [LIST]
        [*]Adjusted some frames/buttons/icons to use 1px rounded edges as all other do as well.
        [*]Changed Chat_Wait Icon (the one that appears when someone is typing) to b yellow and not look like a thought bubble.
        [*]Changed button_speak (the one used when you want to talk with the identity of a creature / character) to yellow and not look like a thought bubble.
        [*]Adjusted all Radial Menu Icons to use Roboto Black instead of regular, where present.
        [*]Changed acicon border (shield symbol behind the AC value) to #DDDDDD colour, to no clash with proficiency star. (mostly 5E relevant)
        [*]Changed magnifying glass to cogwheel. No one I every played with understood from the get go what that icon was for until explained (or tested).
        [*]Fixed Misaligned Character Sheet Tabs in 5E and made them protrude a little more, they are all over the place in any other ruleset however.
        [*]Colored Melee, Ranged, Thrown icon on the Character Sheet - Test for now, will probably revert this.
        [*]Altered "Off Hand" Character Sheet Icon to have the same line weight as the "Primary Hand" and "Two Handed" Icons.
