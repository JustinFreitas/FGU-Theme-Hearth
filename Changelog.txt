[SIZE=4][COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Update to Version 3.0 - Release the Kraken![/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]

[B]Anouncement:[/B]
Finally...with 3.0 I proudly herald the end of Beta Status and am happy to present to you the fruit of MeAndUniques and as well as my labour:

Color Manager (C) TM Yada

You now can with some practice, easily create your own color scheme for my Theme, or even go above and beyond with creating and altering any graphical component in the later presented Figma file.
Theming just go a major step easier and I'm thrilled to see what you guys come up with. I think I can expect some wild experiments!

I created several video tutorials on how to do this, please watch them conciously. While I will try to answer as many questions as I can when they come up, I won't provide any support that goes beyond the scope of the tutorials.
For example I won't teach you how to use Figma.com but for the very specific purpose of altering this theme in the way I intended.


Enjoy!
Sir Motte
