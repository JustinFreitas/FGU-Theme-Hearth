[SIZE=4][COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Update to Version Beta 2.9.8 - Baldurs Cat Flap[/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]

[B]Announcement:[/B]
    This weeks update is now live on the Forge and GitHub.

    It focuses on bringing in basic support for (ADnD)2E! I can tell how much the 2E community cherishes this ruleset, as never before I've had so many help offerings and issue reports than with this ruleset.
    A whopping 23 different players reported to me within a week! Fantastic!

    I hope you're now able to fully enjoy Hearth Theme in 2E!

    As always special thanks to MeAndUnique and Saagael, as well as all the wonderful folks at the Unofficial Developers Guild, as well as Derek From Fantasy Grounds (and Smiteworks in general)


    Enjoy!
    Sir Motte
